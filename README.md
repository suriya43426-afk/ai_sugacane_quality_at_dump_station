# The AI Orchestrator: An End-to-End Software Engineering Case Study in the Sugar Industry

A practical application of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to solve industrial-scale challenges in agriculture.

## Problem Statement
The Thai sugar industry's conventional cane quality inspection process relies on manual visual assessment, leading to critical issues:
*   **Human Error & Inconsistency:** Subjective judgment by human inspectors leads to disputes, unfair pricing for farmers, and inconsistent data.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Manual processes fail to effectively penalize cane burning, a major contributor to PM2.5 air pollution and GHG emissions (**9.6 kgCO2e/ton** of burnt cane).
*   **Operational Inefficiency:** The process is slow, prone to human fatigue, and lacks traceability for auditing.

## Stakeholder Analysis
*   **Farmers:** Need for fair, transparent, and consistent quality assessment.
*   **Sugar Mills (58 factories):** Require accurate data for yield optimization and operational efficiency.
*   **Government Regulators (OCSB):** Mandate traceability and enforcement of anti-burning incentives.

## Installation & Updates (New Workflow)

### 1. Initial Setup (One-time)
1. Install **Git for Windows** on the factory machine.
2. Clone this repository to the machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL> ai_sugarcane_installer
   ```
3. Copy your specific `config.txt` into the folder (if not already present).

### 2. Updating Code
To update the software to the latest version, simply double-click the **`update.bat`** file in the installation directory.
